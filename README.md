SDK Build Notes
The SDK components, and associated sample apps, are built using the
Android Developer Tools (ADT), an Eclipse plug-in.

Google has deprecated ADT, and recommends using their Android Studio
for Android development. Toward this end, the IAM SDK component and
sample application have been converted to the Android Studio format.

The remaining SDK components still require Eclipse with ADT, and should
be converted in the future.
